            <h2>Why Joy?</h2>
            <p>Happiness is a universal yet deeply personal experience. What brings joy to one person may not be the same for another. 
               This project was born out of curiosity— <em>what truly makes people happy?</em> 
               I asked my college friends, <strong>“What is your main source of joy?”</strong> and their responses highlighted the power of 
               <strong>small moments, deep connections, and personal passions</strong> in shaping everyday happiness.</p>

            <p>Inspired by <strong>Inside Out</strong>, a film that helped children understand their emotions through characters like Joy, 
               Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, this project explores how <strong>digital spaces can capture emotions, memories, 
               and perspectives in meaningful ways</strong>. Just like in the movie, where Joy learns that emotions are complex and interconnected, 
               this page is a celebration of the moments that bring us happiness, big or small.</p>

            <p><strong>So, what brings you joy?</strong></p>
